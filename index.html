                 (and their application to fields like genetics and machine learning). I enjoy competitive programming, and am part of the Cornell ICPC team (here's my fluctuating Codeforces <a class = "link" href = "https://codeforces.com/profile/thegreat_gordini14">profile</a>). 
                 In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis, watching sports, and trying new foods.</p>
